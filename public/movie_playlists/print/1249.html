The FBI and Customs agents have had Verone under intense surveillance for over a year with nothing more to show for it than the kingpin's link to illegal street racing. With time running out, officials turn to ex-cop Brian O'Connor and ex-con Roman Pearce to redeem themselves by going undercover as street racers to transport a shipment of &quot;dirty&quot; money for Verone.</td>

			<td colspan="3"><strong>Synopsis:</strong><br/>The sequel to the enormously popular L'Auberge espanole finds Xavier (Romain Duris) at 30 searching for fulfillment in life and love. He is no longer the young control freak whose new friends taught him to loosen up while they shared a Spanish apartment. He is now a would-be novelist in Paris. But instead of becoming a renowned writer, he is barely making ends meet doing puff pieces and the occasional low-grade television movie. His luck in love is not much better. He's still in touch with his ex Martine (Audrey Tautou) and has the occasional one-night stand, but he actually talks old friend and lesbian Isabelle (Cécile De France) into pretending she's his fiancée just to prove to his grandfather that he has someone. Xavier reminisces about his old friends, and as he prepares to meet them for the wedding of William (Kevin Bishop) and Russian ballerina Natacha (Evguenya Obraztsova), he examines the age-old questions of the newly 30: What do I want to be when I grow up, and will my dreams ever come true?</td>

			<td colspan="3"><strong>Synopsis:</strong><br/>Never before in history have fame and thw law been so closely, and so dangerously, aligned. With today's insatiable demand for high-octance television news, everyone from criminals and cops to lawyers and politicians has joined the ranks of attention-grabbing celebrities and hype generators. Murderers hire spin doctors and shares their confessions in prime time. Meanwhile, everyone from thieving low-lifes to the President's lawyers vie for their shot at the limelight. Crime, tragedy, and chaos: we might fear them, but there's no denying that in tody's world, they bring ratings, money and power.So just how far will society's most desperate people go in order to get their &quot;fifteen minutes&quot;? And just how willing is the public to watch? These questions come hurtling to the fore in John Herzfeld's smart, searing thriller 15 Minutes, which brings the edge-of-your-seat thriller into the in-your-face Media Age. Herzfeld's fresh and original take on urban life-andcrime is laced with dark humor, riveting action and incisive social commentary about the troubling crossroads where cops and criminals meet the all-powerful television cameras.At the center of 15 Minutes is a New York double murder that must be solved. But the fast-paced story isn't so much about figuring out the truth of the muurder, as following who controls that truth. This is the thriller as seen thriugh an eye-popping new lens-that of the media's hunt for shocking imagery, no matter the cost. In 15 Minutes, as the cops chase the murderers, the media chases the cops, and the whole thing fuels an escalating firestorm.</td>
